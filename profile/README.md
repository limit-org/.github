# ðŸ‘‹ Hello! We are the Limits organisation.
### We're the team behind the "Limits" forum.
### Limits aims to be a more private forum site similar to reddit with only one topic in mind: Tech.
### We aim to feature:
 - Full profile customisation
 - A large language support for our user interface and potential post translation.
 - A wide variety of topics to post in
 - E2E chat support for any members that choose to allow it
 - And much more to come...
### For the time being, Join our Discord!: https://discord.gg/sgYB9bcrA3 Thats where we are active for now.
